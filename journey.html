                During the COVID-19 pandemic, a family neighbor gave me a book called <cite><a href="https://a.co/d/521wl0w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coding for Kids for Dummies</a></cite> by Camille McCue. At first, I was hesitant to read it, since I had never been particularly interested in computer programming before. But once I opened that book, the way I saw the world began to change. As I worked through the projects, I realized that code wasn't some impossible language of numbers, letters, and symbols. It was something I could actually create and understand to build whatever I could imagine. That moment marked the beginning of my journey into programming and my dream of one day working for Google.

                My time in high school was focused on both academic growth and personal development. Throughout four years, I challenged myself by taking Honors and AP courses while also participating in Chaffey College's Dual Enrollment program. Chaffey College allowed me to take five college-level programming classes during my first 3 years of high school and receive a Certificate of Achievement in Programming Foundations. This gave me early exposure to college-level requirements. Alongside academics, I played competitive soccer, where I learned the value of discipline, teamwork, and perserverance. Balancing rigorous classes with athletics pushed me to become more organized, resilient, and motivated. These skills continue to shape how I approach learning, problem-solving, and long-term goals.

                During high school, I pursued and received a <strong>Certificate of Achievement in Programming Foundations</strong> from Chaffey College, completing a series of progressively advanced courses that built a solid technical foundation. I began with CISPROG-1 and CISIWEB-72 in my freshman year, followed by CIS-1 and CISIWEB-74 in my sophomore year, and finished with CISPROG-5 in my junior year. These courses exposed me to both programming fundamentals and web development, allowing me to develop practical skills in programming, problem-solving, and project design. Earning this certificate demonstrated my ability to handle college-level coursework while still in high school and reinforced my commitment to pursuing a career in software development.

                I earned the California Seal of Biliteracy by demonstrating advanced proficiency in both Spanish and English across reading, writing, listening, and speaking. This distinction reflects four years of formal Spanish study, including one year of AP Spanish, and my ability to communicate clearly and effectively in academic and real-world settings. It represents a sustained commitment to bilingual education, cultural understanding, and strong communication skills.

                Beginning in August 2025, I started taking courses through BYU–Pathway Worldwide to continue advancing my education and prepare for a hopeful transfer to BYU–Provo or BYU–Hawaii. This program has allowed me to maintain academic progress while strengthening essential skills such as independent learning, time management, and academic discipline. Through BYU–Pathway, I’ve remained focused on long-term goals while adapting to the expectations of university-level coursework. This experience reflects my commitment to continuous learning and my determination to pursue a rigorous academic path in higher education.
