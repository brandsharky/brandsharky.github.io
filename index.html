        <h3 id = "intro">Intro</h3>
        <p> In the ocean, sharks are at the top of the food chain. They can eat almost anyting, even things they aren't supposed to. Sharks have survived longer than the dinosaurs and will probably survive long after us humans. These animals are amazing, and by studying them, humans have been able to find inspiration and ideas from these amazing creatures. Scientists have used the shark's shape to create airplanes, jets, and even spaceships.</p>

        <p id = "reason">The <em>shark</em> is awesome because <strong>sharks are just overall amazing.</strong> "With fossil records dating back 400 million years, sharks have outlived the dinosaurs and many other forms of life currently on earth. There are more than 1,000 species of sharks and rays, with new species discovered every year." </p>
        
        <h3 id = "Cool-Facts">Here are some cool facts about sharks!</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li> Sharks don't have bones. Instead, their skeletons are made of cartilage. Cartilage is what your ears and tip of your nose are made of, soft and bendy.</li>
            
            <li> Most sharks have good eyesight. They have a thing in the back of their eyes that helps them see very well in the dark.</li>
            
            <li> Sharks skin feels like sandpaper, rough and hard. It is basically covered in lots of tiny teeth. </li>
            
            <li> Sharks can go into a trance. When the are flipped over, they are unable to move, making them less dangerous and more able to hold and handle. </li>
            
            <li> <strong>The whale shark is like, a whale.</strong> </li>
            
            <li> On the sides of their bodies, sharks have a line of holes called lateral line organs. The lateral line organs are sensitive around small movements in the water. When a fish is swimming nearby, the lateral line organs will pick up the movements and help the shark know where the fish is.</li>
            
            <li> "Unlike humans who can only move their lower jaw around, sharks can freely move both their upper and lower jaws, detaching when it attacks its prey, allowing it to better grip the unfortunate animal and chew it up."</li>
        </ol>
        
        <img class = "shark" src = "https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/animals/shark.png" alt = "shark" width = "500">
        
        <p id = "great-white"> The Great White shark is the largest meat-eating fish on earth today, but there were once sharks that may have been <em><strong>three times bigger</strong></em>! Scientists have named the ancient monster shark <em> <strong>Carcharodon Megalodon</strong></em>. The Megalodon had teeth that were <em><strong>more than six inches long</strong></em>!</p>
        
        <h2 id = "Wonk"> That's So Wonk!</h2>
        
        <p> This section is devoted to crazy things about sharks! </p>
        <ol>
            
            <li> Amazing things have been found in the stomachs of sharks. It seems that they would eat almost anything. Somethings that have been found in the stomachs of sharks are a barrel of nails, a casket of wine, fur coats, a suit of armor, a cannonball, a torpedo, a kimono(Japanese robe), a drum, a treasure chest, a tyre, and a license plate.</li>
            
            <li> Sharks have a sixth sense. "In addition to their killer sense of smell, sharks also can detect prey by tapping in to the small electrical fields that other animals generate using tiny organs called the ampullae of Lorenzini."</li>
            
            <li> Hammerhead sharks have a hammer-shaped head for a reason. The head is packed with 3,000 ampullar pores to track down it's favorite meals.</li>
            
            <li> "A 2009 study found that the placement of their eyes gives them impressive binocular vision and the ability to see 360 degrees."</li>
            
            <li> "While sharks live in all of the world's oceans, a few species are also known to inhabit freshwater lakes and rivers. For example, bull sharks are found in tropical rivers and have evolved to swim between salt and fresh water."</li>
            
            <li> "Great whites don't kill by crushing their prey in their jaws, they prefer a style of attack in which they chomp on their victim and pull back, letting the prey bleed to death before proceeding to eat the rest of them."</li>
            
            <li> Sharks don't sleep. "At least, they don't sleep like humans. Since some species have to continue swimming in order to breathe, instead of falling into a deep sleep, sharks remain semi-conscious."</li>
            
            <li> "Sharks do not have vocal chords and do not use audible sounds to communicate anger or other emotions. Instead, they express themselves physically."</li>
        </ol>
