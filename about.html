            Thanks for checking out my website! This page is all about me and some of the things I enjoy, like programming, soccer, and music. These interests play a big role in who I am and what I love to do. Feel free to keep reading and learn a little more about me.

            <h2>Programming</h2>
            <p>
              Computer programming is one thing that consistently makes me lose track of time. My love for computer programming began at a young age. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a family neighbor gave me my first programming book, <cite><a href="https://a.co/d/521wl0w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coding for Kids for Dummies</a></cite>, by Camille McCue. As soon as I read that book, the way I saw the world began to change. As I began to work through the projects in the book, I realized that code wasn’t an impossible language of numbers, letters, or symbols, but rather something that even I could create. With enough persistence and knowledge, I could build anything I could imagine.

              The journey to pursue this interest has not been easy. I had to rent Chromebooks and books from my public library when I didn't have access to a computer or material to learn from. As my knowledge grew, I was led to learn from <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Khan Academy</a> and <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codecademy</a>. All of this preparation aided me when I began computer programming classes at Chaffey College during my first 3 years in high school. I have earned a Certificate of Achievement in Programming Foundations from Chaffey College during high school. I am currently advancing my education through BYU Pathway and, hopefully soon, at BYU Provo as I have begun to learn to build AI.

            <h2>Soccer</h2>
            <p>
              One important thing to know about me is that I love soccer. Soccer is a huge part of my life. I've been playing soccer since I was 4 years old, and my love for the game has only grown. My favorite player is Lionel Messi. He is best player of the modern era, but I think the G.O.A.T is Pele. My favorite team is FC Barcelona. As for national teams, I support Argentina, Spain, and Brazil. I'm super pumped for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Ever since I began playing, soccer has been one of my favorite ways to unplug from my work and destress. By just being out on the field, whether it be with my team or with my family, I have had memorable experiences, from long car rides to a victory meal after a game. For my second class at Chaffey College during my freshman year of high school, I made <a href="http://edufutbol.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edufutbol.com</a> as my Final Project to introduce people to the game. I love soccer and I hope to continue playing soccer for as long as I can.

            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>
              I love listening to music. The right song can life you up when you're feeling down. Most of the music I enjoy is driven by the guitar, which has always been my favorite instrument. It can fit perfectly into so many genres. I've tried learning to play myself, but a lot of my time was taken up with more important priorities. I value good, clean music. Bad messages or swear words tend to take away from the experience for me. Most of what I listen to falls under the rock umbrella, with artists such as <a href="https://jackjohnsonmusic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jack Johnson</a>, <a href="https://www.blink182.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blink-182</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramones" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ramones</a>, and <a href="https://shop.imaginedragonsmusic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imagine Dragons</a> being my favorites. I know <a href="https://jackjohnsonmusic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jack Johnson</a> and <a href="https://www.blink182.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blink-182</a> sit on opposite ends of the rock spectrum, surf rock and punk rock respectively, but I think that their contrast is what makes them so enjoyable. <a href="https://jackjohnsonmusic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jack Johnson's</a> music helps me mellow down, especially when I'm programming or need to relax. <a href="https://www.blink182.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blink-182</a>, on the other hand, brings that punk spirit and pumps me up when I need an extra push. Together, they show how music fits into different moments of my life, always helping me when I need it most.
